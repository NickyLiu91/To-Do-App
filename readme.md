# To-Do-App

# What are we building?

    We are building a todo app implementation.

# Tech Stack

    Python:         for the main language of the website (backend)
    Flash:          for the backend engine 
    sqlite:         for database integration. (subject to change)
    HTML:           for site structure.
    css:            for styling
    javascript:     for functionality
    bootstrap:      for components
    pytest:
    docker:
    TBA

#  Features

    * docker container
    * pytest integration
    * Themes 



# Project Structure

    * I will use Bootstrap to create components and tie the application togeher.
    * I will use sqliteto store the information
    * I will use docker to  containerize the application for rapid deployment
    * I will use pytest to test the application
    * TBA

# Flow of the Project

    * A user goes to the website and logs in
        * cnot to create auth  feature
    * the user is presented with a blank todo interface (if the user is new then the interface will create a new list for the user). If not, the user will resume previous session.
    * If optional  step is not implemented then:
        * user goes to the site and interacts with the application
        * the application has a list of tasks in which the user can update, delete, create, or read
    * CRUD - create, read, update, delete
